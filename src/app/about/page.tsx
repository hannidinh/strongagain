                    <strong>StrongAgain</strong> is more than an app ‚Äî it‚Äôs a quiet corner of the internet created from heartbreak,
                    for healing. I built it while going through one of the most painful emotional experiences of my life.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    I was in the middle of my own heartbreak ‚Äî a time full of confusion, replaying memories, and longing for clarity.
                    During that time, I traveled to California, carrying the weight of my own emotional storm. While at the airport,
                    I noticed two women crying. One of them even sat next to me on the flight. We didn‚Äôt speak ‚Äî but I felt an invisible
                    thread connecting us. In their grief, I saw myself. I wished I had a way to offer them hope.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    That‚Äôs when I knew: if I‚Äôm hurting and they‚Äôre hurting, then maybe others are too ‚Äî silently, without support.
                    I wanted to build something that could gently guide us all through the pain and back into strength.

                    His words helped me realize how important it is to actively heal, not just wait for time to pass.

                    to break the cycle of idealizing those who hurt us,
                    to rediscover our voice through quotes and affirmations,
                    and to find strength in seeing that you are not alone.
